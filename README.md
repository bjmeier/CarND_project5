### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I used 64x64 and 128x128 windows. I used an overlap of 25%. I searched the right side of the image.  The ystart value is 392 pixels.  The 64x64 windows included three verticle steps and the 128x128 windows searched four vertical steps. Images are searched in the code blocks under the Add windows... and Find cars.. blocks.  These sizes and search areas did a good job of overing the area of interest.  The 25% overlap provided a good balance between speed and search precision.  Because I am using 8 x8 hog blocks, moving two at a time aided ease of implementation and performance speed.

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on the above two scales using YUV plus gray 4-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)

Here's a link to my video result.  This video was generated a a rate slightly greater than 3 frames per second on a laptop c an Intel 7th Generation i5 core.

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap.  The heatmap is generted fromt square of the distance generated by `svc.decision_function`.  The heatmap is then clipped at 2.5.  This heatmap is then fed into an Exponential moving average (EMA) filter with a smoothing factor of 0.05. The result of the averaged heatmap then is subjected to a minimum threshold of 1.5. I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected. 

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Video showing window inputs

To show how this works as a function of time, I created a video.  This video shows the detected cars in blue.  Black boarders indicate uncertain (close to the decision line).  Blue lines indicated more certain car detections.  Detected cars are shown by the red border.  A link to this video is given below.

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

The most difficult issue was dealing with shadows.  To counteract this, a low pass filter was required. The elimated any panic stops, but delayed detection.  To counter this, I suggest using a more robust deep learning  based detection method.
